# Komali's C++ Discord Bot
This is a very crude Discord Bot I've made in Visual Studio (not currently working with MingW)<br>
It heavily relies on [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) and [WsClientLib](https://github.com/rotter12/WsClientLib) to connect to the websocket and interpret the data<br>
For sending messages and fetching data it uses [libcurl](https://github.com/curl/curl) even though I regret not using a simpler option :P<br>
<br>
This isn't meant to be a library or anything but I hopefully will keep adding onto it
